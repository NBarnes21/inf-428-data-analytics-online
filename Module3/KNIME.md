### Column Selection

The column selection GUI is repeated in many nodes, including the column filter, to control which columns operations are applied to. The mechanics of column selection are important to many KNIME operations. 

Take a look at the figure below.  The four important buttons are circled in blue.  The single forward arrow includes the selected columns, the double forward arrow includes all columns, the back arrow removes selected columns, and the double back arrow removes all columns.

## KNIME DataWrangling example

There is a KNIME Data Wrangling example on the KNIME Server under INF428->Data_Wrangling->DataWrangling.  The example shows how to concatenate, filter and join data.  Study the example and use it as a reference for assignment 3. 

Hint -> remember to get the menu of options associated with a node, click on the node.
