## PANDAS  

* Two dimensionsal data structure  
* sort of like a spread sheet  
* sort of like a relational database  

## Key Concepts

Key concepts of Pandas are below.  You should learn these concepts by working through the [Class Pandas Notebook](https://github.com/bnorthan/inf-428-data-analytics-online/blob/master/python/notebooks/data_wrangling/Pandas.ipynb) and other tutorials (such as [this one](https://www.learndatasci.com/tutorials/python-pandas-tutorial-complete-introduction-for-beginners/))  
* use ```import pandas as pd``` to get access 
* use ```df=read_csv('file name')``` to open the file  
* use ```print(df.shape)``` to see size of data  
* use ```print ("columns: ",df.columns``to see the headers describing data categories  
* use ```print ("index: ",df.index)``` to see the index that is used to reference data rows  
* use df.values to get data as numpy array  
* series -> each column of dataframe is a series
