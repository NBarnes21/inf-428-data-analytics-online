# Visualization with Python and Pandas

We will learn visualization with Python a few different ways.  Each way is demonstrated using a series of notebooks. 

## Visualization with Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python.  Use Matplotlib to plot Python structures such as lists and arrays.   The Matplotlib documentation can be found [here](https://matplotlib.org/) and a matplotlib gallery can be found [here](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html).  

## Basic Visualization with Matplotlib

Download and work through this [notebook](https://github.com/bnorthan/inf-428-data-analytics-online/blob/master/python/notebooks/visualization/BasicPython.ipynb) to learn the basics of Matplotlib.  This example show how to do a line chart.

## Python examples 

[This notebook](https://github.com/bnorthan/inf-428-data-analytics-online/blob/master/python/notebooks/visualization/PythonExamples.ipynb) shows how to create other basic plot types.  The basic plot types are. 

### Line Charts

Line charts are useful to show trends

### Bar Charts

Bar charts are useful when performing a comparison
